# ICC Tournaments Explorer (v2)

Enhanced React + Vite app with richer UI, animations (framer-motion), and a larger sample dataset of finals for ODI World Cups, Champions Trophy and T20 World Cups.

Data is editable in `src/data/index.json`. This version includes finals info (date, venue, scoreboard, man of the match/series).

Run locally:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Build:
```
npm run build
```

Notes: The included dataset contains finals and selected summary info for major editions. For a full match-by-match historic dataset, I can fetch and populate the repo with accurate records (this requires pulling data from reliable sources).
